## **Project Overview**

The aim behind this project is to demonstrate my skills in developing a Full Stack Application using the Django framework. I have chosen to create a fully functioning online e-commerce application focused around the sale of handcrafted gifts, where users will be able to browse available products, purchase, and review previous orders.

### **Mandatory Requirements**:

* **Django Full Stack Project**: Build a Django project backed by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

* **Multiple Apps**: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps.

* **Data Modeling**: Design a relational database schema well-suited for the domain.

* **User Authentication**: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so.

* **User Interaction**: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend.

* **Use of Stripe**: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc. After paying successfully, the user would then gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Note that for this project Stripe's test functionality should be used, rather than actual live payments.

* **Structure and Navigation**: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.

* **Use of JavaScript**: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.

* **Documentation**: Write a README.md file for the project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.

* **Version Control**: Use Git & GitHub for version control.

* **Attribution**: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README

* **Deployment**: Deploy the final version to a hosting platform such as Heroku.

* **Security**: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

### **Main Technologies**:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django

* Relational database using PostgreSQL

* Stripe payments

* Additional libraries and APIs
